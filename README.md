# Linear-Regression
A Beginner Guide to Linear Regression
What is Linear Regression?
Its use is premised on the assumption that the dependent variable can be explained as some linear combination of the independent variable (Lantz, 2019). More precisely, it seeks appropriate plane in more than two dimensions, or the appropriate line in two, to go through the data with minimal deviation between prediction and reality. The equation for linear regression is as follows:
y=β0+β1x1+β2x2+⋯+βnxn+ϵ
Where:
•	yyy is the predicted target value.
•	x1,x2,…,xnx_1, x_2, \dots, x_nx1,x2,…,xn are the input features.
•	β0\beta_0β0 is the intercept.
•	β1,β2,…,βn\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_nβ1,β2,…,βn are the coefficients.
•	ϵ\epsilonϵ is the error term.
Step 1: Understanding the Dataset
It is critical to have knowledge and understanding of the data while doing modeling.
Dataset Overview
This is a multi-character or multi-variable dataset, in which the target variable or the dependent variable for which we will want to predict the result with linear regression methods. That is, These are explanatory variables which are used to predict the output. 
•	Features: Some of the characteristics could be: age, income, temperature, etc.
•	Target variable: That is the outcome of prime interest. It may be sales figures, the value of property, or examination results.
Target Variable Distribution
This calls for encoding the target variable, if it is categorical, into numeric values. For example, let's suppose that our target variable had classes like yes and no; we then encoded them as 1 and 0, respectively. Target Variable Distribution It plots a target variable distribution that reveals its variability, showing in histograms or box plots (Shmueli, Patel, and Bruce, 2010). Whether the data is normally distributed or skewed The existence of outliers Class imbalances, if categorical
